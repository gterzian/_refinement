Accompanying material for [`A Tale of Two Refinements`](https://medium.com/@polyglot_factotum/a-tale-of-two-refinements-f6cdb2a3e4d8)


Note about the commit history:

- Up to [`remove .DS_Store`](https://github.com/gterzian/_refinement/commit/af8eb1eda5f2a4f3868edfd5718254452b7a6c6a)
  I was messing around, and I also accidentally switched models used.
- So I started again, by deleting the contents of `main.rs`, adding `prompt.md`, and by sticking to Gemini 2.5 Pro, at [`with prompt, first, gemini`](https://github.com/gterzian/_refinement/commit/4874109e8dcdba9605f35283ce85c497629bfa5a)
- The story in the blog post starts with that commit, and ends with [`seventh, and final, take. It's a wrap.`](https://github.com/gterzian/_refinement/commit/68666036d233045e885907f299d45c30ab10093e)
- The last few commits are manual edits after all the code generation to fix some typos(mine) and naming issues(mine again, in the spec names) to make the material more presentable.
